## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Computer Science undergraduate** focused on **Software Engineering and Systems Development**.

My interests lie at the intersection of:

- Systems programming  
- Distributed systems  
- Backend architecture  
- Compiler design  
- Scalable full-stack applications  

I enjoy designing systems from first principles — understanding how they work internally, how they scale, and how to structure them cleanly.
